The article I'm going to give a review of is taken from the journal "Science daily" the headline of the article is "What's coming next? Scientists identify how the brain predicts speech 

The authors of the article are: Yukiko Kikuchi, Adam Attaheri, Benjamin Wilson, Ariane E. Rhone, Kirill V. Nourski, Phillip E. Gander, Christopher K. Kovach, Hiroto Kawasaki, Timothy D. Griftiths, Matthew A. Howard, Christopher I. Petkov. 

The topic of the article is about how the brain predicts speech. 

The key issue of the article is a new study that has shed light on how the brain helps us to predict what is coming next in speech. Their research reveals how individual neurons coordinate with neural populations to anticipate events, a process that is impaired in many neurological and psychiatric disorders such as dyslexia, schizophrenia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). 

At the beginning of the article the authors touch upon the questions of mechanisms in the brain's auditory cortex involved in processing speech and predicting upcoming words, which is essentially unchanged throughout evolution. Their research reveals how individual neurons coordinate with neural populations to anticipate events, process that is impaired in many neurological and psychiatric disorders such as dyslexia, schizophrenia and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) 

The article describes in details that learning another language can help school-age children do better in math and can delay the onset of dementia in older adults. Also going dancing regularly is the best protection against dementia compared to 16 different leisure activities, such as doing crossword puzzles and bicycling. Playing board games and practicing a musical instrument are the next best activities for keeping the mind sharp. Dancing is probably so effective because it combines cognitive exertion, physical exercise and social interaction, said Trumbo. 

It must be emphasized that an approach first developed for studying infant language learning, the team of neuroscientists led by Dr Yuki Kikuchi and Prof Chris Petkov of Newcastle University had humans and monkeys listen to sequences of spoken words from a made-up language. Both species were able to learn the predictive relationships between the spoken sounds in the sequences. 

At the end of the article the authors sum up by saying that harness insights on predictive signals in the brain to develop new models to study how these signals go wrong in patients with stroke or dementia, The long-term goal is to identify strategies that yield more accurate prognoses and treatments for these patients. 

I have found the article important and interesting for me.
