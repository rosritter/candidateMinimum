My name is Bikbualatov Timur Khabrashitovich. I graduated in 2024 from Kazan University in Institute of Computational Math and Information Technologies. I cannot say, that I have always been interested in machine learning and data analisys, but my interest in the this field emerged a few years ago, when i realized that neural networks have taken root in our society, and there’s no getting away from them. At first, I wasn’t a fan of how probabilistic algorithms were popping up instead of the usual ones. But once I accepted it, I got curious about jumping into this growing field. I started by dipping my toes into computer vision since it felt the most straightforward to grasp. You’ve got an image you can see, and a method that processes it—pretty simple. Later, I got hooked on audio processing. The cool thing about audio is that it’s invisible, yet we can still pick it up. The methods for processing it, though, aren’t quite as easy to wrap your head around intuitively. Because of it i decided to continue my education in PhD.

So, back in my master’s thesis, It was all about visual noise and figuring out how to lower noise impact on video. Got an article published on that and did a few talks too. Now, for my dissertation, I’m diving into audio noise—trying to really understand what it’s all about. My goal is to come up with an algorithm, probably using some deep learning tricks, to generate noise that can mess with modern voice activity detection models, making them less effective. And then, I plan to figure out how to build a defense against that kind of generated noise. 

Like I mentioned earlier, audio processing has a steeper learning curve. Since I haven’t been at it for too long, I figured I’d start my research from the ground up—basically, get a grip on what kinds of noises are out there, what their deal is, and what the usual tricks are for getting rid of them. After that, I’ll need to zoom in on neural networks and the challenges they face with domain formation. These days, with smart speakers and all those robot assistants getting super popular, interfaces that let people interact with devices in a more natural way—like using their voice—are really taking off. And those assistants are getting more and more access to our gadgets. So, it’s pretty crucial to nail down accuracy at every step of the interaction. The first step is the robot actually picking up the command right. For example, it might miss an important command or totally mishear it because of background noise. So, on top of improving the speech understanding algorithms, it’s just as important to work on noise removal algorithms to cut down their impact on the input data.

Currently I am still analyzing and writing my thesis and, every time I read more about machine learning, I keep being surprised about the learning opportunities offered by this great sphere, like audio processing and enhancement. I hope to continue with this capacity for wonder and be able to express it to others through my research work. Thank you for your attention.
